# Tabs-on-JavaScript
a function that allows you to make tabs on the site

sometimes we need to implement such a construction on the site: we have several buttons on the site, and by clicking on one of the buttons, we open a certain block on the site, and all other blocks that are not related to the required one become invisible. Only the first block is initially visible.

===================================

we pass 3 arguments to the function.

q = the block where the buttons are located, by clicking on one of which, we open a specific block on the site
w = these buttons
e = content that is hidden / visible
